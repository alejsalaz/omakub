# My Personal Fork of Omakub

This project is a personalized fork of Omakub, designed to turn a fresh Ubuntu-based installation (e.g., Linux Mint) into a fully-configured, modern development environment tailored to my specific needs. The goal is to provide a cohesive setup that incorporates my preferred tools and configurations, ready to use with a single command.

## Features

- **Customized Development Environment**: Includes preferred tools for terminal work, optimized for a Linux Mint setup.
- **Essential Tools Only**: Focus on terminal applications and lightweight setup without heavy desktop dependencies.
- **Pre-configured with Preferred Fonts, Theme, and Applications**:
  - Font: Meslo Nerd Font
  - Theme: Dracula
  - Key applications: `obs-studio`, `spotify`, and `steam`

## Installation

To set up this customized environment, clone the repository and run the installation script:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alejsalaz/omakub.git ~/.local/share/omakub
cd ~/.local/share/omakub
